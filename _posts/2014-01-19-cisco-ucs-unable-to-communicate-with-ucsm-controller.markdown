When upgrading UCS firmware, it's important to periodically check the state of the HA clustering service running between the two Fabric Interconnects. The infrastructure portions of UCS are generally redundant due to these two FIs but only if the clustering service has converged - so it's important to use the "show cluster state" command to verify this is the case. During a firmware upgrade to 2.2(1b), I checked this:

    6296FAB-A# connect local-mgmt 
    
    6296FAB-A(local-mgmt)# show cluster state 
    Cluster Id: 8048cd6e-5d54-11e3-b36c-002a6a499d04
    Unable to communicate with UCSM controller

The error message - "unable to communicate with UCSM controller" worried me, and it was given when I ran the "show cluster state" command as well as the "cluster lead" command - the latter of which is necessary to switch an FI's role in the cluster from subordinate to primary. Seeing as I couldn't do either of these things because of this error, I felt like I was in a bind, unable to verify the state of HA.

First of all, I'd like to point out that this info is also available in the UCSM GUI. I took a look there and noticed that it was reporting HA was fully converged and ready:

[![FI_HA]({{ site.url }}assets/2014/01/FI_HA.png)]({{ site.url }}assets/2014/01/FI_HA.png)

As we'll see shortly, this can actually be a preferred way of verifying the HA cluster state. For now, suffice it to say that this was a valid indicator of the state of HA, and the "unable to communicate with UCSM controller" error I was seeing was purely cosmetic.

The TAC engineer I was working with was kind enough to load the revered UCS debug plug (available only internally to Cisco TAC and is generally not used unless something is seriously messed up) into my UCS domain and show me a "backdoor" command that accesses UCSM directly to verify the HA state.

The reason I was seeing the error outside of the context of this debug plugin is actually a little disturbing, and is one of several reasons why I'm super uncomfortable with UCSM release 2.2(1b) in general (some I've already wrote about, some I have yet to).

The TAC engineer I was working with mentioned that the UCSM XML API, which is used by both the UCSM Java GUI as well as any third party tools (i.e. UCS PowerShell module aka PowerTool) offers direct access to UCSM itself. The "show cluster state" and "cluster lead" commands available from the CLI of the Fabric Interconnects is apparently powered by a "middle man" binary on the filesystem that works as a proxy between the clustering services in UCSM and the command line interface on the FIs.

This binary, as of firmware 2.2(1b), is called "pidof", found in the /bin directory (which is viewable only with this internal only debug plugin, to my knowledge).

Turns out that prior to this version of UCSM (2.2(1b)), this binary was in the /sbin directory, so in this release it was moved. Unfortunately, the symlinks present on the fabric interconnects still point to the old location until upgraded - so if you follow the upgrade docs (you should) then you'll get this error after activating UCSM but before you activate the Fabric Interconnects. This is kind of a pain in the ass because you can't verify the cluster state using the CLI until you activate the FIs. Sure, you should look at the UCSM GUI as I showed you before, but during an upgrade of a system running 10+ chassis that is FULLY in production, these kind of errors still shake you up a little bit.

So the moral of the story is that this kind of error should have been caught in QA and customers/partners should have been advised of it in the release notes. It may be cosmetic in nature but as I said, that excuse usually doesn't cut it when an entire production data center is on the line.

As usual, follow the docs to the letter, and if you see errors like this, call TAC. It appears that I may be getting some traction with these errors I've been having with this release and will hopefully help drive a new release of UCSM - every issue I run into convinces me further that these newer versions need better/more Quality Assurance before release.
