  bio: |
    Matt Oswalt is an all-around technology nerd, currently focusing on networking,
    software development, and everything in between. He is at his happiest in front
    of a keyboard, next to a brewing kettle, or wielding his silo-smashing sledgehammer.
    He spends his days diving deep into the intersection of networking and software,
    and likes to blog about his experiences when he comes up for air. You can follow him on
