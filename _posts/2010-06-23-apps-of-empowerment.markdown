This will be a short one (*cough*, I'm at work, *cough*) but I gotta share these links.

Downloadsquad.com shares some great links, but these stories in particular give lists of apps that any computer-savvy person must at least be aware of.

Before you go googling to download some shoddy software that may or may not do what you want it to, check out these lists first:

Again, thanks to Downloadsquad.com for these. They're old posts, but it's a great start for those looking for some items to add to the toolbelt.
