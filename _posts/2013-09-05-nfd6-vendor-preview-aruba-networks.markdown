I'll be the first to admit, I don't really know that much about [Aruba Networks](http://techfieldday.com/sponsor/aruba/). They're most widely known for their work in the wireless area and that's  an area of technology I have yet to play with. As someone who is admittedly wireless-green, I'm eager to get schooled. While they may be new to me, they are heavily involved with the Tech Field Day community, especially at Wireless Field Day events.

I have seen a lot of stuff from Aruba in the past that shows they have more to offer than simple wireless access infrastructure, so I'm pretty excited to see what they have for us at [Network Field Day 6](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/). I have a little bit of experience with NAC/NAP implementations, so hopefully I have at least a little perspective to offer there. As always, I'm a data center network junkie so I'll also be interested in any products that they have in that area. Maybe new virtual WLC design stuff?

It's also quite possible that they're coming ready to [talk about SDN](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240185264/Aruba-SDN-tools-to-change-wireless-network-models) - which will be interesting, coming from them.

I'm excited to hear from them, if for no other reason than I simply don't know what to expect. Open book!
