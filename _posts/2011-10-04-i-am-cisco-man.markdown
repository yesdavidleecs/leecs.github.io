Hello.

Let me begin by saying you have arrived.

[![]({{ site.url }}assets/2011/10/cisco_man.png)]({{ site.url }}assets/2011/10/cisco_man.png)

Pardon me, where are my manners? I am CiscoMan - the comforting presence at the top of a large number of Cisco documents such as configuration and installation notes for Catalyst switches.

I'm here to tell you that everything is going to be alright - that it's okay to be scared. CiscoMan is here to help you out.

Believe me, you're not my first. Most people that see me are just like you. Maybe your network is down, or you're struggling through a difficult configuration - either way, I got you  covered.

Look at the way I'm sitting. Clearly I'm a confident badass that regards your so-called "problem" as a mere detail as I strive for eternal networking sainthood. This position tells you that I've seen your problem before and completely decimated it like a steamrolled Twinky.

Read the pages contained herein. Take my words of wisdom, and let them inspire you to push towards the finish line. Complete the seemingly impossible task set before you with style, so that you too may sit here as I do, with your leg crossed over the other, "man-style", and a smug look on your face that says "This is my network. There are others like it, but this one is mine."
